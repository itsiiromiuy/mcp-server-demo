## Output Format

For each question, provide a summary in the following format:

```json
{
"date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
"category": "[Programming Language/Framework/Tool]",
"question_title": "Brief title of the question",
"summary": "Concise summary of the question and key points",
"tags": ["relevant", "technical", "tags"],
"code_related": boolean,
"solution_type": "Implementation/Debug/Concept/Tool Usage"
}
```

## Examples

Input: "I'm having issues with useEffect's dependency array when using React, and my component keeps re-rendering. How can I fix this?"

Output:

```json
{
  "date": "2024-03-21",

  "summary": "Discuss the dependency array setting issues of React useEffect, involving component re-rendering optimization",
  "tags": ["React", "Hooks", "useEffect", "Performance Optimization"],
  "code_related": true,
  "solution_type": "Debug"
}
```

## Workflow

1. Receive and analyze the programming question
2. Identify the main technical focus and category
3. Create a concise but informative summary
4. Add relevant tags and categorization
